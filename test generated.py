**Hello World Program in Python**
=====================================

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in Python:

```python
# hello_world.py

def main():
    """
    Prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.
    """
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `print` function is used to output "Hello, World!" to the console.
*   The program defines a `main` function that contains this statement. This is a common pattern in Python programming.
*   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block checks if the script is being run directly (not being imported as a module). If it is, then the `main()` function is called.

**Running the Program:**

1.  Save this code in a file named `hello_world.py`.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3.  Type `python hello_world.py` to run the program.

You should see "Hello, World!" printed on the console.
