The addition of two numbers is a basic mathematical operation that involves combining the values of two or more numbers to get a new total. Here are some examples:

1. Addition of two single-digit numbers:
   2 + 3 = 5
   4 + 2 = 6
   7 + 1 = 8

2. Addition of two double-digit numbers:
   14 + 25 = 39
   46 + 17 = 63
   95 + 42 = 137

3. Addition of two three-digit numbers:
   456 + 278 = 734
   982 + 135 = 1117
   756 + 489 = 1245

4. Addition of a single-digit number and a two-digit number:
   2 + 14 = 16
   5 + 25 = 30
   8 + 46 = 54

Remember to follow the order of operations when adding numbers, which is:

1. Parentheses (if any)
2. Exponents (if any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

This will ensure that you perform the calculations correctly and get the desired result.
